# CS-230_Operating_Platforms
Final Assignment for CS-230 SNHU

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game titled, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently only available in android app form.
        Requirements:
            * Steady Rate rendering image
            * Web-based platform
            * Cross Platform Capability
            * Real-Time Interaction
            * Handles concurrent users for multiplayer
            * Data Protection and unique player identifiers
            * Single Instance game
            * Scalable
            * Resource allocation for multiplayer
            
In the recommendations at the end of the document, I think I did a good job researching and gaining further understanding of cloud-based environments. I the recommendations portion I provide many sources. I believe working through the document has helped gain a better understanding of the application needs and helped in analyzing an environment that fits the clients needs. This lays the foundation for how to approach the code in tandem with design patterns.

In my approach I took what the client currently has (android based game, windows platforms for devs) and thought how can the client attain their goals in a cost-effective, quick, efficient manner in order to create the game to be cross-platform and scalable. My initial thought was to take the game and create it as a Http web-based game, and then use a wrapper to make it also reach android and apple users. However, without more information of the infastructure of the current app, I decided to go a different route in my recommendation and research. 

For the future, having a deeper understanding of all the possible OS/infastructure to consider and combining that with analysis documentation to better understand the client needs. I belive the documentation is provided here is a great way to analyze the potential software design route based on the clients needs. However, the client already has a system in place; I believe utilizing system analyisis documentation to achieve a deeper understanding of the clients current system could improve the software analysis document.
